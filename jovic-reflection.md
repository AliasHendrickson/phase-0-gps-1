What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
- Fetch.  I didnt understand what the difference between Fetch and Pull was, and why I would ever use Fetch/Merge versus just using Pull.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
- Fetch versus Pull.  Now I understand that what Pull does is grab all changes regardless if you want them or not.  Fetch allows you to get the changes without merging them in, review them, and choose which or all changes you'd like to merge.  Then merge them over.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
- Fetch versus Pull
- How to view changes after you fetched them but before you pull them in

What still confuses you about git?
- moving a file from a child to a parent directory.  Using the command "mv" moves a file from the parent to the child.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
- Awesome!  Alec was a great first pair.  We broke the ice and he was super easy to work with.  I dont feel like 1 person took charge at all, and we worked well together.  Our guide Neal was awesome too, he sort of sat back and let us do our thing.  He was there to answer any questions and to guide us, but not distract us.  This gives me hope that future GPS's will be this fantastic!
