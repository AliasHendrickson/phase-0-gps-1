**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
  I struggled with the definition of commit, and I was even more unsure about push and pull and merge. I didn't fully understand what happened to a file when it was committed.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
  I understand Commits as a lump of changes that are committed to the local repository. Then, I can push those commits to the branch in the GitHub repository. If a collaborator makes changes to the master on his local repository and pushes them to GitHub, I can pull those changes from GitHub down to my local repository so that my local master branch is up to date with the remote master branch.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
  I asked for clarification on `git push` and `git commit` and `git pull`.
  I asked about best practices for driving, navigating, and commit messages.

**What still confuses you about git?**
  The workflow is still a bit confusing. My guide mentioned a good resource to go over that presents me with everything I will need to know for Phase 0 and I have made it a point to review that until it becomes second nature.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
  It was informative and helpful to see how someone else has been navigating their terminal and using commands. My guide was really helpful with his explanations and presenting me with resources I could use. I felt a little awkward when I was the navigator because I was unsure of what to look at. I wanted to watch the driver typing commands, research issues and read directions all at the same time. It was difficult, but I'm sure I will become more comfortable with the role as I get more practice.
